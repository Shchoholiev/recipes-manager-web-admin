## Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v18.x recommended) and npm  
- Angular CLI (v16)  

### Setup Instructions  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shchoholiev/recipes-manager-web-admin.git
cd recipes-manager-web-admin/recipes-manager-web-admin

# Install Angular CLI globally if not installed
npm install -g @angular/cli@16

# Install project dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
ng serve
```
Then navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

## Configuration  
The app uses environment files to set API URLs:

- `src/environments/environment.ts` - for development  
- `src/environments/environment.production.ts` - for production  

Example snippet from `environment.ts`:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'https://sh-recipes-manager-api-dev.azurewebsites.net'
};
```

Update `apiUrl` to point to your backend API endpoint.  

**Authentication:**  
Stores JWT tokens (`accessToken` and `refreshToken`) in localStorage after login. The JWT interceptor adds the token to API requests' Authorization header.  

**Azure Deployment:**  
A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to build and deploy to an Azure Web App named `sh-recipes-manager-admin` on pushes to the `master` branch.  

**Routing:**  
- `/login` - Login screen  
- `/main` - Admin main dashboard (protected)  
- `/logs` - Application logs (protected)  
- `/open-ai-logs` - OpenAI logs with user filtering (protected)  
- `/users` - Paginated users list (protected)  
- `/edit-user/:id` - User edit form (protected)  

**Note:**  
Use `ng build --configuration production` for production builds. The build output is in `dist/recipes-manager-web-admin/`.
